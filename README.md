# Tweet For Our Lives
Tweet For Our Lives is a work in progress twitter sentiment analysis project aimed at preventative action against the mental health crisis America faces. Suicide is an epidemic made worse by an actual pandemic, the hidden consequence of quarantine and limited social interaction. Tweet For Our Lives hopes to use machine learning to help flag tweets for suicide-sensitive content, respond with mental health resources, and most importantly, help people.

## Planned Development
- Gain access to the Twitter API to improve the response capabilities of the program
- Either creating our own data set from scraping twitter and manually labelling over time or by obtaining one from reaching out to the author's of several research papers on the subject
- Optimizing the neural network further by experimenting with TF-IDF and further data preprocessing

## Features
- Web scraper that scrapes twitter for tweets
- Long-Short Term Memory recurrent neural network that analyses suicidal sentiment in the data
- Data processing pipeline to feed into the neural network

## Built With
- Selenium and BeautifulSoup
- Tensorflow
- nltk
- scikit-learn
